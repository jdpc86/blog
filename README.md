Welcome to my blog!

My name is Kostas Kloudas. I am a software engineer and [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) [PMC and committer](https://flink.apache.org/community.html#people). I am mainly interested in distributed systems and here you can find some of the things that I consider worth sharing.

I hope you enjoy...
